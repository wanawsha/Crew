## Note on Follow/Unfollow‼️

This project implements the Follow feature using the Noroff Social API v2.
Following a user works as expected using PUT /social/profiles/{name}/follow.
However, Unfollow is not currently supported by the API:
Attempts with DELETE /social/profiles/{name}/follow return Route not found.
Using PUT again returns: “You are already following this profile”.
How this project handles it:
Users can follow other profiles.
If a user is already following a profile, the UI displays “Following ✓” and disables the button.
The unfollow option is disabled, and this limitation is documented here.

## Authentication and Local Storage
When a user logs in, the following values are saved in `localstorage`:
- `accessToken` - used for authenticated API requests
- `apiKey` - required by the Noroff API
- `userProfile` - stores the logged-in user's details (name, email, etc.)

These are cleared when the user clicks **Logout**
